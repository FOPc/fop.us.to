<h3>About us</h3>
<ul>
FreedomOP Remastered was orginally hosted, paid for, and managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/craftersmith12">CrafterSmith12</a> on the ProBoard's and ExodusHosting network for roughly a year.  After roughly a year, Crafter migrated ownership from himself to <a href="https://twitter.com/camzie99">Camzie99</a> where the server remained and regained popularity until where it was finally handed over to an unpronounced leader.

<h1>Farewell,</h1>
As poet Cam Smith once said, “...saying goodbye hurts the worst when you know it's the final word.  It comes across like a curse...so now the final word on the final page of the final chapter of this narrative we made is my weak conscious whispering words through my mouth, the very words I prayed would never come out.”<br/><br/>
Today, Friday October 9th 2015, I'm afraid I am whimpering this unforgivable word:  Goodbye.
<h2>Necessity and time</h2>
The necessity and time is upon us, not when we deny, not when we lie, but, instead when we face the irrefutable facts.   I'll be brief, I'll be blunt; the time has arrived, the time in which we must adapt, we must modify, and we must change.  I am sorry to my friends, I am sorry to my enemies, but, it's time we transferring ownership.  We're transferring to a new era, dominated by both triumph and destruction.  We don't know what lies ahead, we don't know if we'll sink or swim.  We only know we're sinking.  We're sorry, truly.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
